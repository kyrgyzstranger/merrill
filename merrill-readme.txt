I used Intellij IDEA Ultimate 2019.1 to build the service.
Apache Tomcat server 9.0.22 is used to run the service.
Simply copy merrill-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war at /target folder to /webapps directory of Tomcat.
Then start the server and use the url below to get the result of this assignment:
http://localhost:8080/merrill-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/merrill/users
Or you can run the application locally by executing the main() method at MerrillApplication.class
